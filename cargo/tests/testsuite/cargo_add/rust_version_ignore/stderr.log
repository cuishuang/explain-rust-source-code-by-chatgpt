    Updating `dummy-registry` index
      Adding rust-version-user v0.2.1 to dependencies.
error: failed to select a version for the requirement `rust-version-user = "^0.2.1"`
candidate versions found which didn't match: 0.2.1, 0.1.0
location searched: `dummy-registry` index (which is replacing registry `crates-io`)
required by package `cargo-list-test-fixture v0.0.0 ([ROOT]/case)`
perhaps a crate was updated and forgotten to be re-vendored?
