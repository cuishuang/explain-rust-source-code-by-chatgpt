# RFC 2685 - 2020-05-28 - Dev Workflow Simplification

Vector's `Makefile` serves a variety of purposes, and this RFC attempts to tame the complexity of common dev tasks, improving contributor and team member experience.

It proposes a practical base `environment` container that merges the functionality of our non-integration test containers into one. It then suggests making common dev `make` tasks to rely on the caller environment having all dependencies, done at the same time it suggests adding `make` tasks to run common `make` tasks inside the environment. Finally, it suggests updating documentation to suggest users can use their native toolchains, `docker`.

It proposes these changes such that our team and contributors will have to explicitly **opt in** to virtualization/containerization, and attempts to do it in a convenient, unsurprising way.

## Motivation

Currently, Vector's build system is a wild, powerful beast with a lot of amazing features and mechanisms. Unfortunately, complexity has kind of gotten away from us, and we need to reclaim ownership of the automations.

Notably, our system works right now, as is, and we are not strongly motivated to replace or rebuild things just for the fun of it. We are motivated to make small, forward looking changes that improve the maintainability of our product.

**Before we do this, we should make sure we agree this offers realistic benefits to our future maintenance.**

## Guide-level Proposal

> **Note:** Replaces the **Development â†’ Setup** section of the `[CONTRIBUTING.md](http://contributing.md)` file.

We're super excited to have you interested in working on Vector! Before you start you should pick how you want to develop.

For small or first-time contributions, we recommend the Docker method. If you do a lot of contributing, try setting up your own toolchain! It'll be way faster and feel more smooth.

### Use a Docker or Podman environment

> **Targets:** You can use this method to produce AARCH64, Arm6/7, as well as x86/64 Linux builds.

This is ideal for users who want it to "Just work" and just want to start contributing. It's also what we use for our CI, so you know if it breaks we can't do anything else until we fix it. ðŸ˜‰

**Before you go farther, install Docker or Podman through your official package manager, or from the [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/) sites.**

```bash
# Optional: Only if you use `podman`
export CONTAINER_TOOL="podman"
```

By default, `make environment` style tasks will do a `docker pull` from GitHub's container repository, you can **optionally** build your own environment while you make your morning coffee â˜•:

```bash
# Optional: Only if you want to go make a coffee
make environment-prepare
```

Now that you have your coffee, you can enter the shell!

```bash
# Enter a shell with optimized mounts for interactive processes.
# Inside here, you can use Vector like you have full toolchain (See below!)
make environment
# Try out a specific container tool. (Docker/Podman)
make environment CONTAINER_TOOL="podman"
# Add extra cli opts
make environment CLI_OPTS="--publish 3000:2000"
```

Now you can use the jobs detailed in **"Bring your own toolbox"** below.

Want to run from outside of the environment? Clever. You can run any of the following:

```bash

# Validate your code can compile
make check ENVIRONMENT=true
# Validate your code actually does compile (in dev mode)
make build-dev ENVIRONMENT=true
# Validate your test pass
make test SCOPE="sources::example" ENVIRONMENT=true
# Validate tests (that do not require other services) pass
make test ENVIRONMENT=true
# Validate your tests pass (starting required services in Docker)
make test-integration SCOPE="sources::example" ENVIRONMENT=true
# Validate your tests pass against a live service.
make test-integration SCOPE="sources::example" AUTOSPAWN=false ENVIRONMENT=true
# Validate all tests pass (starting required services in Docker)
make test-integration ENVIRONMENT=true
# Run your benchmarks
make bench SCOPE="transforms::example" ENVIRONMENT=true
# Rebuild Vector's metadata
make generate ENVIRONMENT=true
# Serve the website on port 3000
make website ENVIRONMENT=true
# Format your code before pushing!
make fmt ENVIRONMENT=true
```

We use explicit environment opt-in as many contributors choose to keep their Rust toolchain local, and use `make generate ENVIRONMENT=true` etc.

### Bring your own toolbox

> **Targets:** This option is required for MSVC/Mac/FreeBSD toolchains.

To build Vector on your own host will require a fairly complete development environment!

Loosely, you'll need the following:

- **To build Vector:** Have working Rustup, C++/C build tools (LLVM, GCC, or MSVC), Python, and Perl, `make` (the GNU one preferably), `bash`, `cmake`, and `autotools`
- **To run integration tests:** Have `docker` available, or a real live version of that service.
- **To build the Website:** Have a working modern Ruby and Bundler toolchain available, also `bundle install` in the `scripts/` directory.
- **To run the Website in Dev:** Have a working `node` environment with `npm`/`yarn`, also run `yarn` from the `website/` directory.
- **To run `make check-component-features`:** Have `remarshal` installed.

If you find yourself needing to run something (such as `make generate`) inside the Docker environment described above, that's totally fine, they won't collide or hurt each other. In this case, you'd just run `make environment-generate`.

We're interested in reducing our dependencies if simple options exist. Got an idea? Try it out, we'd to hear of your successes and failures!

In order to do your development on Vector, you'll primarily use a few commands, such as `cargo` and `make` tasks you can use ordered from most to least frequently run:

```bash
# Validate your code can compile
cargo check
make check
# Validate your code actually does compile (in dev mode)
cargo build
make build-dev
# Validate your test pass
cargo test sources::example
make test SCOPE="sources::example"
# Validate tests (that do not require other services) pass
cargo test
make test
# Validate your tests pass (starting required services in Docker)
make test-integration SCOPE="sources::example" AUTOSPAWN=true
# Validate your tests pass against a live service.
make test-integration SCOPE="sources::example" AUTOSPAWN=false
cargo test --features docker sources::example
# Validate all tests pass (starting required services in Docker)
make test-integration
# Run your benchmarks
make bench SCOPE="transforms::example"
cargo bench transforms::example
# Rebuild Vector's metadata
make generate
# Serve the website on port 3000
make website
# Format your code before pushing!
make fmt
cargo fmt
```

If you run `make` you'll see a full list of all our tasks. Some of these will start Docker containers, sign commits, or even make releases. These are not common development commands and your mileage may vary.

## Doc-level Proposal

This change requires no User-facing docs changes. The changes to `[CONTRIBUTING.md](http://contributing.md)` are sufficient.

## Prior Art

Vector currently has an extensive `Makefile` and it does its job just fine. It is, unfortunately, rather confusing.

To help you picture it, common dev `make` tasks such as `make fmt` and `make check` do, roughly, the following:

- Start `make`, [calculate](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector/blob/1d8e88057f68d9cf9292ddc9edb69a7f8d3b3f92/Makefile#L7-L14) the default features
- [Run](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector/blob/1d8e88057f68d9cf9292ddc9edb69a7f8d3b3f92/Makefile#L3) the `/scripts/run.sh`. (via shebang this runs `env` which invokes `bash` )
- Run the `/scripts/prepare-target-dir.sh` script (via shebang, `env` then `bash`)
  - This `read` s then `grep`s the `docker-compose` yaml file, [running](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector/blob/1d8e88057f68d9cf9292ddc9edb69a7f8d3b3f92/scripts/prepare-target-dir.sh#L15-L17) `sed`, `sort`ing, then `uniq` ing the jobs
  - Make a directory as the current user for each of those.
- Run the `./scripts/docker-compose-run.sh` script (via shebang, `bash` , no `env` call)
  - Sets some env vars
  - Runs a `docker-compose rm` call to remove the existing service (this starts a `python` runtime, which dispatches to `docker`)
  - Runs `docker-compose up` on the given container.

At this point what happens differs by job. None of this is particularly slow, **it's just a lot.**

**It works fine.**

There are tools like `hab` (from the Habitat project) and `packer` that can be used to make containers as well!

## Sales Pitch

- Having an omnibus container means **we can build, publish, and cache the container**, and use it for CI or our users.
- This creates a **dependency test** since our CI will only ever have dependencies in the environment.
- This is **low effort**, hopefully lower effort than our current situation
- We can **remove `docker-compose`** as a dependency.
- We can **remove a lot of tasks** from the `docker-compose` and begin cleaning out many scripts from `scripts/`
- We can **feel more comfortable editing our build** process.

## Drawbacks

- This adds **another official dev env, Native, instead of just Docker.** This means we may need to provide support.
- It's **not backwards compatible**, meaning users who depend on the current `docker-compose` system might experience frustration.

## Outstanding Questions

- Windows/Mac/FreeBSD builds via `make build` et all will produce native binaries natively, we should be review those docs.
- This RFC does not scope in integration tests beyond letting the `environment` run them. We may find motivation to explore a more **_slick_** solution in the future.

## Rationale & Alternatives

Why change what we have?

- Running all these scripts and `docker` commands to run things like `cargo fmt` feels very... _stinky_... to experienced programmers.
- Most of our core team avoids the `Makefile` since it's been deemed not useful.
- We can reduce some duplication and redirection in the build system (hopefully understanding it better)
- We get side benefits like better dependency management.
- We can mature this system in fairly clever and optimized ways.

Alternatives:

- We could make the `environment` container in another packaging system/OS
- We could keep using our current system.
- We could explore merging some of our existing images but not provide an environment.

## Plan Of Attack

1. Introduce this RFC & a POC branch
2. Get preliminary consensus this is good path forward
3. Add `DOCKER_SOCKET` passing and support integration testing
4. Cross-OS testing
6. Explore handling `make environment-%` commands via wildcard
7. Acceptance testing (Test including new contributor test)
8. Merge preliminary support
